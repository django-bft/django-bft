Welcome to django-bft - documentation
=====================================

Introduction
------------

**django-bft** is a Django application that handles large file transfers.  The
application's frontend has both a flash upload as well as a javascript 
upload version.

**django-bft** was origianlly created for Utah State University 
to fulfill a specific need of sending large files through email.

The site can be viewed at https://bft.usu.edu

Requirements
------------

1.	**Web server**

	**Apache** using **mod-wsgi** is the prefered web server of choice and, currently,
	is the only web server that has been tested with django-bft.  Web servers such as
	Lighttp and Nginx may work, but have not been tested.
	
	**Note:** django-bft uses ajax to display a progress bar during upload.
	As such, the Django development web server will not be able to upload files
	since it is only single threaded.
	
2.	**Database**

	All databases supported by Django should work with django-bft.
	(Postgres, MySQL, and Oracle)
	
3.	**Django**

	django-bft has been created using the latest version of Django (1.3).
	Django 1.1x or later will probably work, but with the change in how **static**
	files are handled, you are advised to install django-staticfiles for static file serving.

Installation
------------

To get this application up and running, please follow the steps below:

1.	Create a Django production environment using the setup of your choice.
	Refer to: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/install/

2.	Create a new Django Project::

		$ django-admin.py startproject <projectname>

3.	Install django-bft to either your PYTHON_PATH or in a folder inside your project:

	*	Install from pip::
	
		$ pip install django-bft
		
	*	`Download`__ and install from source::		

		$ python setup.py install
		
	*	Install source to local directory::
	
		$ python setup.py build
		$ cp build/lib/bft /<PROJECT_ROOT>/
		
4.	Add the following to your **settings.py** file:

	*	Add 'bft', 'staticfiles' and 'admin' to INSTALLED_APPS::
	
			INSTALLED_APPS = (
				...
				'django.contrib.admin',
				'django.contrib.staticfiles',
				'bft',
			)
			
	*	Make sure your static file finders are configured::
	
			STATICFILES_FINDERS = (
			    'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder',
			)
			
	*	Add 'bft.context_processors.bft' to the context processors::
	
			from django.conf import global_settings
			...
	
			TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
			    'bft.context_processors.bft',
			) + global_settings.TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS
			
	*	Add 'bft.utils.upload_handlers.UploadProgressCachedHandler' to the file
		upload handlers::
	
			from django.conf import global_settings
			...
			
			FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS = (
			    'bft.utils.upload_handlers.UploadProgressCachedHandler',
			) + global_settings.FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS
			
	*	(Optional) - You might want to change the location of the
		FILE_UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR.  This setting is the location of where files
		will be temporarily be stored while uploading.  The default for this is 
		the operating systems temp directory.  If space is limited at this 
		directory, it is advised to change this setting.
		
5.	Modify **app_settings.py** as needed.

6.	If reCaptcha is to be used, a public and private key will be needed.

	Refer to: http://www.google.com/recaptcha
	
	The python reCaptcha library is also **required**.  You can install it 
	onto your PYTHON_PATH by using pip::
	
		$ pip install recaptcha-client
		
7.	Because this app is designed to upload very large files, enforcing size
	restrictions using Django is not recomended and rarly works.  It is better 
	to add this enforcement on the web server layer.  You can do this on Apache
	by adding the following directives to your Apache config::
	
		LimitRequestBody 1073741824 #The same size as specified in your app_settings.py file
		ErrorDocument 413 http://<SERVER_NAME>/413error/
		
8.	If you care about your files being secured, you will probably want to protect
	the directory where files are stored using apache::
	
		<Location /media/files>
			Order allow,deny
			Deny from all
		</Location>
		
	You may also want to consider adding the necessary directives to redirect
	non-ssl traffic over to ssl::
	
		RewriteEngine On
		RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
		RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}
		
9.	Map your urls.py to django-bft's urls.  An example of this would be::

		urlpatterns = patterns('',
			...
			(r'', include('bft.urls')),
		)
		
10.	Setup a cron job to handle file archiving and deletion.  An example of this
	could be::

		#!/bin/sh

		./manage.py deleteuploads
		./manage.py deletetempfiles
		
11.	Don't forget to collect your static files and sync your database::

		$ python manage.py syncdb
		$ python manage.py collectstatic
		
FAQs
------------
1.	Q: Running `python manage.py deleteuploads` gives an error ```AttributeError: 'Settings' object has no attribute 'BASE_DIR'```
	
	A: adding this to your settings.py file solves the problem::
	
		import os.path
		# Assumes the settings file is located in `your_project.settings` package.
		BASE_DIR = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(__file__, "..", ".."))
	P.S: was tested on Django-1.4.3
